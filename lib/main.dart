// 1. The currentCityProvider is a StateProvider that holds the current city value. 
// It allows the UI to both read and modify the current city value.

// 2. The weatherProvider is a FutureProvider that fetches the weather emoji based on the current city. 
// It depends on the currentCityProvider and automatically updates whenever the current city value changes.

// 3. Inside the MyHomePage widget, the currentWeather variable is created by watching the weatherProvider. 
//It represents the current weather emoji and automatically updates based on the current city.

// 4. The UI is built to display the current weather emoji and a list of cities. 
//The weather emoji is displayed using currentWeather.when, which handles different states of the weather data (data, error, and loading).

// 5. The city list is generated using ListView.builder, and each city is represented as a ListTile. 
//The currently selected city is identified by comparing it with the value obtained from currentCityProvider.

// 6. When a city is tapped, the currentCityProvider is updated by modifying its state using the ref.read(currentCityProvider.notifier).state syntax. 
//This triggers a re-evaluation of the weatherProvider, fetching the corresponding weather emoji for the newly selected city.

// In summary, the currentCityProvider holds the current city, and the weatherProvider fetches the weather emoji based on the current city. 
//The UI watches the weatherProvider to display the current weather and allows the user to select a city, which updates the currentCityProvider and triggers a re-fetch of the weather emoji.
